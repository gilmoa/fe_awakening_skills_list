# Fire Emblem Awakening
## Skill list

The wikia list is damn heavy on me. This is cleaner and faster.
Also comes with a basic filter!

## **src/parsy.py**
format the raw (wiki copy-paste) skill list
into awesome json.

## **src/skills.json**
the awesome json (parsy.py > skills.json)

###Everything is from

http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Skills_in_Fire_Emblem_Awakening

nice wiki but way to heavy on me for quick checks.
This is just like a front end to the cool stuffs.

bootstrap, jquery, fontawesome and google fonts.
